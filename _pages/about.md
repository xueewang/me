I'm a third-year PhD Candidate in [Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/), advised by [Prof. Yang Zhang](https://yangzhang.dev/) in the [Human-Centered Computing & Intelligent Sensing Lab](https://hilab.dev/). 

My research focuses on human-computer interaction in wearable sensing, such as VR/AR glasses, smartwatches, or smart rings. In my research, I designed some innovative systems that can recognize activities, interpret speech, or estimate pose and gestures, to create more intuitive interactions. I hope my work can enhance user experiences, by making technology more naturally responsive to human actions.

Happy to share my research journey with you!
