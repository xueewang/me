Now I'm a PhD Candidate in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/) at the [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/), advised by [Prof. Yang Zhang](https://yangzhang.dev/) in the [Human-Centered Computing & Intelligent Sensing Lab](https://hilab.dev/).

My research focuses on **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in Wearable Sensing**, such as VR/AR glasses, smartwatches, or smart rings. In my research, I designed some innovative systems that can recognize activities, interpret speech, or estimate pose and gestures, to create more intuitive interactions. 

Before joining UCLA, I graduated from [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2022. I also interned at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/), [Ernst & Young](https://www.ey.com/en_us), and [Shanghai Media Group](https://www.smg.cn/review/index.html).

Happy to share my research journey with you! Download my [CV]() here.
