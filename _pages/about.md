I'm a third-year PhD Candidate in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/) at the [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/), advised by [Prof. Yang Zhang](https://yangzhang.dev/) in the [Human-Centered Computing & Intelligent Sensing Lab](https://hilab.dev/).

My research focuses on **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in Wearable Sensing**, such as VR/AR glasses, smartwatches, or smart rings. In my research, I designed some innovative systems that can recognize activities, interpret speech, or estimate pose and gestures, to create more intuitive interactions. 

Before joining UCLA, I graduated from [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) with a Bachelor's Degree in Information Science in 2022, advised by [Dr. Bruce Robert Land](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/bruce-robert-land). I also worked at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/), [Ernst & Young](https://www.ey.com/en_us), and [Shanghai Media Group](https://www.smg.cn/review/index.html).

I hope my work can enhance user experiences, by making technology more naturally responsive to human actions.
Happy to share my research journey with you!
