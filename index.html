In my research, I designed some innovative systems that can recognize activities, interpret speech, or estimate pose and gestures, to create more intuitive interactions. I hope my work can enhance user experiences, by making technology more naturally responsive to human actions.</p> <p>Happy to share my research journey with you!</p> </body></html>
